The paper uses two data sets. A synthetic set, Syn-Data, generated randomly to compare the proposed approaches in order to determine the best one based on computational experience. Subsequently, we make a real application of the proposed model for the location of electric vehicle charging stations in the city of Trois-Rivières, Quèbec. For this purpose, we use the instance of the paper by Lamontagne et al (2022), and we upload here the parameters defined in our application.
